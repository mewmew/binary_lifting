% TODO: add section for Revgen and Dagger.
% ref: 2018 BinRec, dynamic binary recovery.pdf
% > Revgen [11] and Dagger [5] can disassemble binaries to LLVM bitcode, but the IR they produce contains machine specific constructs and unresolved control flow. It would require extensive tool-specific analyses and transformations before that IR could be coherently understood by off-the-shelf compiler analyses.
